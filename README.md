A ___Lightweight Minecraft: Java Edition client (no cheats)___ with Fabric mods that include cosmetics (Leaf Cosmetics), fps boost (Sodium, Lithium, Noxesium, OptiFine), additional mods (Freelook, KeyStrokes, Motion Blur, WayPoints, Coords, etc). This client is coded with **C# and Java** and it is only compatible on **Windows** (for now).

- ‚úÖ Open Source Code (excluding server/database code for obvious reasons)
- and some more...

### üí° Mods we're thinking of adding (after a few versions obviously)

ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è **P.S.** *Majority of the mods are going to be mods created by other developers found on **[modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com)**, **[curseforge.com](https://curseforge.com)**, and other sources/websites. Each creator of the mod will be credited accordingly. If the creator of the mod allows for modifications, it will be modified accordingly in an appropriate manner to create a dynamic and professional look for Leaf Client and make it easily accessible through the client.*
