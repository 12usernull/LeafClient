This project is currently frozen. The source code is out, however I do not plan on continuing the project.

A ___Lightweight Minecraft: Java Edition client (no cheats)___ with Offline & Online Mode and Fabric mods that include cosmetics (Cosmetica), fps boost (Sodium, Lithium, Noxesium, MoreCulling, LazyDFU), additional mods. This client is coded with **C# (Client & Launcher) and Java (Mods)** and it is only compatible on **Windows** (for now).

## 🤔 Project Status
~~This project is currently still *under development*. There is no expected release date, however I am planning to release this project's first version with the basics which are:~~

**[ ♻️ = In progress | ✅ = Finished ]**

- ✅ Fabric Support (Forge, LiteLoader and OptiFine cancelled as we can have & add more features on Fabric with better performance mods)
- ✅ Sodium, Lithium, Noxesium integration
- ✅ Xbox/Microsoft Login (Mojang login is added but deprecated, all Minecraft accounts are now on Microsoft)
- ✅ Offline Mode (with less features)
- ✅ Servers Quickjoin (Hypixel, PVPLegacy, 2B2T and more)
- ✅ Change Username/Skin
- ✅ Fabric Installer
- ✅ Launch Settings
- ✅ Change Logs/Launcher Updates
- ✅ Multiple Versions (1.8, 1.12, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 1.20) **[__⚠️WARNING:__ ALL MODS WILL ONLY BE TESTED ON VERSIONS FROM 1.16-1.20.4+, MEANING SOME FEATURES/MODS INTEGRATED WITH THE CLIENT MAY NOT WORK ON VERSIONS LOWER THAN 1.16]**
- ✅ Open Source Code
- and some more...

### 💡 Mods we're thinking of adding (Some may already be added)
- Freelook
- Motion Blur
- KeyStrokes
- HUDs: FPS, Waypoints, Ping, Coordinates, Armor Status, Direction, CPS, Reach
- Hitboxes
- Hit Color
- Physics on dropped items
- Lighting
- Zoom
- Toggle Sneak/Sprint
- Low Fire
- and more...

🤓☝️ **P.S.** *Majority of the mods are going to be mods created by other developers found on **[modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com)**, **[curseforge.com](https://curseforge.com)**, and other sources/websites. Each creator of the mod will be credited accordingly. If the creator of the mod allows for modifications, it will be modified accordingly in an appropriate manner to create a dynamic and professional look for Leaf Client and make it easily accessible through the client.*

In the future, we are planning on creating our own Mods that are only compatible when using Leaf Client. However, for now we are using free online mods to speed up the project release.
