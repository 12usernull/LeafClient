A ___Lightweight Minecraft: Java Edition client (no cheats)___ with Fabric mods that include cosmetics (Leaf Cosmetics), fps boost (Sodium, Lithium, Noxesium), additional mods (Freelook, KeyStrokes, Motion Blur, WayPoints, Coords, etc). This client is coded with **C# and Java** and it is only compatible on **Windows** (for now).

## ü§î Project Status
This project is currently still *under development*. There is no expected release date, however I am planning to release this project's first version with the basics which are:

**[ ‚ôªÔ∏è = In progress | ‚úÖ = Finished ]**

- ‚úÖ Fabric Support (Forge, LiteLoader and OptiFine cancelled as we can have & add more features on Fabric with better performance mods)
- ‚úÖ Sodium, Lithium, Noxesium integration
- ‚úÖ Xbox/Microsoft Login (Mojang login is added but deprecated, all Minecraft accounts are now on Microsoft)
- ‚úÖ Offline Mode (with less features)
- ‚úÖ Servers Quickjoin (Hypixel, PVPLegacy, 2B2T and more)
- ‚úÖ Change Username/Skin
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Fabric Installer
- ‚úÖ Launch Settings
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Change Logs/Launcher Updates
- ‚úÖ Multiple Versions (1.8, 1.12, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 1.20) **[__‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING:__ ALL MODS WILL ONLY BE TESTED ON VERSIONS FROM 1.16-1.20.4+, MEANING SOME FEATURES/MODS INTEGRATED WITH THE CLIENT MAY NOT WORK ON VERSIONS LOWER THAN 1.16]**
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Open Source Code (excluding server/database code for obvious reasons)
- and some more...

### üí° Mods we're thinking of adding (after a few versions obviously)
- Freelook
- Motion Blur
- KeyStrokes
- HUDs: FPS, Waypoints, Ping, Coordinates, Armor Status, Direction, CPS, Reach
- Hitboxes
- Hit Color
- Physics on dropped items
- Lighting
- Zoom
- Toggle Sneak/Sprint
- Low Fire
- and more...

ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è **P.S.** *Majority of the mods are going to be mods created by other developers found on **[modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com)**, **[curseforge.com](https://curseforge.com)**, and other sources/websites. Each creator of the mod will be credited accordingly. If the creator of the mod allows for modifications, it will be modified accordingly in an appropriate manner to create a dynamic and professional look for Leaf Client and make it easily accessible through the client.*
